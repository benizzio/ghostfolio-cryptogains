# Implementation Plan: Ghostfolio Gains Reporting

**Branch**: `[001-ghostfolio-gains-reporting]` | **Date**: 2026-05-02 | **Spec**: `/specs/001-ghostfolio-gains-reporting/spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-ghostfolio-gains-reporting/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Build an installed cross-platform Go terminal application that defaults setup to the Ghostfolio cloud origin `https://ghostfol.io`, allows a self-hosted origin override, opens a short-lived authenticated Ghostfolio sync session for a specific registered local user, stores successful per-user setup and activity history only in local token-derived encrypted storage, and generates yearly PDF capital gains and losses reports from normalized activity history. The baseline architecture uses a Bubble Tea TUI, exact decimal domain math with no cross-currency conversion in this feature slice, stdlib HTTP integration against Ghostfolio's observed `api/v1` endpoints, and account-scope-to-wallet mapping for wallet-scoped basis methods, while keeping the report pipeline separate from storage, transport, and presentation concerns.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Go 1.26.2
**Primary Dependencies**: `charm.land/bubbletea/v2`, selected `charm.land/bubbles/v2` components, `github.com/cockroachdb/apd/v3`, `golang.org/x/crypto/argon2`, `github.com/signintech/gopdf`, Go standard library (`net/http`, `encoding/json`, `crypto/aes`, `crypto/cipher`, `os`, `path/filepath`)
**Storage**: Local-only encrypted per-user snapshot files in the OS application data directory; Argon2id key derivation from the runtime Ghostfolio token; AES-256-GCM protected payload with an authenticated cleartext header; atomic rewrite on update  
**Testing**: `go test` with table-driven unit tests and `httptest.Server` integration suites; statement coverage from `go test -coverprofile`; branch and file coverage gate via `github.com/Fabianexe/gocoverageplus` until an in-repo verifier replaces it  
**Target Platform**: Installed terminal application for Linux, macOS, and Windows terminals with local filesystem access and PDF file output  
**Project Type**: Single-module Go TUI application  
**Performance Goals**: Unlock cached data in under 2 seconds on supported hardware; complete sync normalization and persistence for 10,000 activities without freezing the UI; generate a yearly PDF report for 10,000 activities spanning 5 years in under 2 minutes  
**Constraints**: Ghostfolio token and JWT are runtime-only; no recoverable token trace on disk; non-HTTPS production origins are rejected with a blocking error and only explicitly permitted local-development origins may use HTTP; financial domain logic uses arbitrary-precision decimals only and baseline calculations intentionally skip currency conversion by treating source base-currency amounts as price-equivalent; persisted data stays local and is replaced atomically after confirmed server mismatch; no CGO-required runtime dependency in the baseline distribution
**Scale/Scope**: Multiple encrypted local profiles per machine, each unlocked by its own Ghostfolio token; up to 10,000 stored activities per profile; one report type; five supported cost basis methods with Ghostfolio account scope treated as the wallet-equivalent input when required; default sync target is the Ghostfolio cloud origin with optional self-hosted replacement; Ghostfolio `api/v1` integration treated as runtime-validated rather than fully stable

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Pre-research gate status: PASS  
Post-design gate status: PASS

- [x] Security: Persistence is justified only for encrypted setup and activity-cache reuse. Ghostfolio credentials remain runtime-only, per-user snapshots stay local-only and unlock solely from the user-entered token via Argon2id, the storage design follows the OWASP Cryptographic Storage Cheat Sheet, non-HTTPS production origins are rejected with a blocking error, and the OWASP Top 10:2025 review scope covers cryptographic failures, authentication failures, insecure transport/configuration, outdated components, logging leakage, and data-integrity tampering.
- [x] Precision: Domain math uses `apd/v3` arbitrary-precision decimals, JSON numbers are parsed without floating-point domain storage, canonical decimal strings preserve source scale at rest, baseline reporting intentionally performs no currency conversion and treats source base-currency amounts as price-equivalent inputs, and one documented output-rounding policy is applied only at the report boundary.
- [x] Testing: Integration-first tests drive setup, unlock, sync, normalization, mismatch replacement, and PDF generation via mocked Ghostfolio responses; unit tests isolate complex basis calculators, normalization rules, and crypto envelope code; statement and branch/file coverage are explicit release gates.
- [x] Dependencies: Every planned third-party library is justified against the standard library or a custom implementation and is researched in `research.md` for maintenance, community acceptance, security posture, release freshness, and recent activity.
- [x] External APIs: Ghostfolio integration is necessary, and the observed `api/v1` auth and activities endpoints, bearer-JWT model, pagination behavior, default cloud origin `https://ghostfol.io`, live cloud health/auth verification, account-scoped activity data used as wallet-equivalent input when needed, 400/401/403 failures, redaction risk, and host-origin security implications are documented.
- [x] Architecture: The design uses a single Go module with isolated domain, storage, Ghostfolio client, report rendering, and Bubble Tea presentation layers so tax logic remains independent from TUI and filesystem code.

**Structure Decision**: Use a single Go module rooted at the repository root. Bubble Tea screens live under `internal/tui`, Ghostfolio HTTP and encrypted persistence remain in infrastructure packages, and all financial rules live under `internal/domain` so calculation logic is testable without filesystem or terminal dependencies.

## Complexity Tracking

No constitution violations require justification for this plan.
