# Specification Quality Checklist: Sync Data Validation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-05-09
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Current checklist state reflects a manual pass against the current feature spec package.
- Spec package was remediated to define saved-setup fields, startup invalidation rules, explicit failure categories, recovery behavior, measurable success-criteria notes, documentation acceptance, and traceability into plan and tasks.
- Scope is explicitly limited to boilerplate, setup, sync data selection, and communication validation only.
- Persistence of synced data and report generation are deferred to future feature specifications.
- Security wording now states that the Ghostfolio security token is the only user-entered secret, remains memory-only, must not appear in logs, dumps, traces, diagnostics, or persisted artifacts, and that remembered setup uses local device protection instead of token-derived protection in this slice.
- Transport rules now state that self-hosted origins require `https` in production usage, with `http` allowed only in explicit development mode.
- Integration wording now references the validated Ghostfolio sync contract instead of embedding raw API details in the feature spec.
- Key entities now reuse the validated subset of the reference model: `AppSetupConfig`, `GhostfolioSession`, and `SyncValidationAttempt`.

## OWASP Top 10 Review

- [x] A01 Broken Access Control: The application persists one bootstrap profile under the current OS user's config directory and does not implement multi-user sharing inside the product. Residual exposure is limited to compromise of the local workstation account.
- [x] A02 Cryptographic Failures: This slice persists no Ghostfolio security token, JWT, or activities payload. Custom origins default to `https`, and `http` is allowed only with explicit development mode. Unix-like platforms apply restrictive file permissions where supported.
- [x] A03 Injection: Ghostfolio requests use fixed endpoints, standard HTTP request construction, and JSON encoding for the token field. This slice does not invoke shells, SQL interpreters, or template engines with user-controlled content.
- [x] A04 Insecure Design: Setup must complete before sync validation can run. Token entry is deferred until the `Sync Data` workflow, and successful validation explicitly does not enable storage or reporting behavior.
- [x] A05 Security Misconfiguration: Stored origins are canonicalized and revalidated on every startup. Remembered `http` origins are rejected unless the current process was started with explicit development mode.
- [x] A06 Vulnerable and Outdated Components: The slice keeps a small dependency set limited to Bubble Tea, selected Bubbles widgets, Lip Gloss, and a development-only coverage helper pinned in `go.mod`.
- [x] A07 Identification and Authentication Failures: The Ghostfolio security token is sent only to the selected canonical origin. The returned JWT remains runtime-only and is cleared after each attempt.
- [x] A08 Software and Data Integrity Failures: Bootstrap setup writes go through a temporary file, `fsync`, and atomic rename so interrupted writes do not leave partially accepted configuration behind.
- [x] A09 Security Logging and Monitoring Failures: Project-owned user messages and diagnostics must not expose the Ghostfolio token, JWT, request body, or raw response payload. Redaction helpers cover project-owned diagnostic surfaces.
- [x] A10 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): This is a user-run terminal client rather than a server-side fetcher, but the selected origin still controls outbound requests. Origin validation constrains targets to absolute origins with no path, query, fragment, or user info, and plain `http` requires explicit development mode.

## Generated Deep Audit

**Purpose**: Deep author-facing review of requirements quality for the sync-data-validation slice
**Created**: 2026-05-09
**Focus**: General Spec Quality
**Depth**: Deep
**Audience**: Spec Author

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK001 Are the startup-readable `AppSetupConfig` fields enumerated explicitly enough to prevent implementers from inferring additional persisted data? [Completeness, Spec §FR-005, Spec §Key Entities]
- [x] CHK002 Does the spec define what constitutes a valid `AppSetupConfig` beyond setup completion and origin rules, or are other required fields left implicit? [Gap, Spec §FR-004, Spec §FR-005]
- [x] CHK003 Are user-visible failure requirements complete for rejected token, timeout, unreachable host, non-2xx response, malformed JSON, contract mismatch, and incompatible server cases? [Completeness, Spec §FR-012, Spec §Edge Cases, Contract §Failure Handling Rules]
- [x] CHK004 Are requirements defined for remembered setup that becomes invalid at startup because the stored origin is malformed, now disallowed, or cannot be canonicalized? [Coverage, Gap, Spec §SEC-005, Plan §Setup Persistence Rules]

## Requirement Clarity

- [x] CHK005 Is "machine-local setup storage" defined precisely enough to establish acceptable locations and protections on each supported OS? [Clarity, Spec §FR-005, Plan §Setup Persistence Rules]
- [x] CHK006 Is "local device protection" specific enough to distinguish required safeguards from best-effort behavior on platforms with limited permission controls? [Ambiguity, Spec §SEC-003, Spec §QUAL-001]
- [x] CHK007 Are "user-visible success result" and "user-visible failure result" defined with enough required content to keep outcome messaging consistent across implementations? [Clarity, Spec §FR-011, Spec §FR-012, Contract §Validation Result Screen]
- [x] CHK008 Is "compatible Ghostfolio server" quantified tightly enough to separate supported contract drift from generic connectivity failure? [Clarity, Spec §INT-001, Contract §Compatibility Rules]
- [x] CHK009 Is "first actionable setup or main-menu screen" defined precisely enough to exclude disagreement about splash, loading, or transient bootstrap states? [Ambiguity, Spec §SC-001]

## Requirement Consistency

- [x] CHK010 Do the persistence boundaries align across `FR-005`, `FR-013`, `FR-017`, `SEC-003`, and `SEC-004` about what is stored, what is never stored, and when deletion resets setup? [Consistency, Spec §FR-005, Spec §FR-013, Spec §FR-017, Spec §SEC-003, Spec §SEC-004]
- [x] CHK011 Do the origin security rules stay consistent between `FR-003`, `SEC-005`, the assumptions on explicit development mode, and the contract compatibility rules? [Consistency, Spec §FR-003, Spec §SEC-005, Spec §Assumptions, Contract §Compatibility Rules]
- [x] CHK012 Does User Story 3's reference to the selected server's "supported Ghostfolio authentication flow" conflict with the singular anonymous-auth contract required by `FR-008`? [Conflict, Spec §User Story 3, Spec §FR-008, Contract §Authentication Contract]
- [x] CHK013 Do the success conditions in `FR-010` fully align with the contract's additional `take=1`, timestamp-parsing, and first-activity validation rules? [Consistency, Spec §FR-010, Contract §Activities Probe Contract]
- [x] CHK014 Do the UI-facing requirements consistently exclude persistence and report-generation actions across User Story 2, `FR-014`, `FR-015`, and the TUI workflow contract? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 2, Spec §FR-014, Spec §FR-015, Contract §Main Menu Screen]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [x] CHK015 Can the "100% of launches" and "100% of attempts" success criteria be audited objectively without additional definition of fixtures, environments, and acceptable test scope? [Measurability, Spec §SC-001, Spec §SC-002, Spec §SC-003, Spec §SC-006]
- [x] CHK016 Are the success criteria explicit about which outcomes must be observed by automation versus which are only user-facing wording requirements? [Clarity, Spec §SC-002, Spec §SC-003, Spec §FR-015]
- [x] CHK017 Are the non-persistence success criteria traceable to concrete requirement statements rather than standing alone as unlinked outcomes? [Traceability, Spec §SC-004, Spec §FR-013, Spec §SEC-004]
- [x] CHK018 Is there an explicit traceability path from requirements and success criteria to task or test coverage, or is readiness inferred indirectly from the task list? [Traceability, Gap, Spec §Functional Requirements, Spec §Success Criteria, Tasks §Phase 3, Tasks §Phase 5, Tasks §Phase 6]

## Scenario Coverage

- [x] CHK019 Are recovery requirements defined for user interruption during setup or during an in-flight validation attempt, or intentionally excluded from this slice? [Gap, Contract §Setup Screen, Contract §Sync Validation Screen]
- [x] CHK020 Are requirements defined for switching between hosted and custom origins after initial setup, including how prior remembered state is replaced? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1, Contract §Setup Screen]
- [x] CHK021 Are repeated successful validations covered explicitly, not just retry after failure? [Gap, Spec §FR-016, Spec §User Story 3]
- [x] CHK022 Are version incompatibility or remote contract-drift scenarios addressed distinctly from generic unsuccessful responses? [Coverage, Gap, Spec §INT-001, Spec §FR-012, Contract §Compatibility Rules]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [x] CHK023 Is timeout handling defined with enough specificity to determine whether it should be reported differently from generic connectivity failure? [Clarity, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-012]
- [x] CHK024 Are contradictory activity probe responses addressed in the requirements, such as `count > 0` with an empty array or `count == 0` with returned items? [Edge Case, Contract §Activities Probe Contract, Spec §FR-009, Spec §FR-010]
- [x] CHK025 Are non-JSON success responses, wrong content types, or structurally valid but semantically invalid timestamps covered explicitly, rather than being folded into a broad "invalid retrieval result" bucket? [Coverage, Gap, Spec §FR-009, Contract §Runtime Validation Rules]
- [x] CHK026 Does the spec define the expected behavior when the bootstrap setup file is removed after launch but before the next persisted read? [Gap, Spec §FR-017, Spec §Assumptions]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [x] CHK027 Are busy-state responsiveness requirements measurable enough to judge "event loop remains responsive" without implementation-specific interpretation? [Measurability, Spec §QUAL-003, Spec §SC-006, Plan §Performance Goals]
- [x] CHK028 Are keyboard-usage and focus-management requirements complete for all screens, not only menus and token entry? [Coverage, Contract §Global UX Rules, Contract §Screen Contract]
- [x] CHK029 Are terminal color fallback requirements specific enough to define the minimum acceptable degradation when truecolor is unavailable? [Clarity, Plan §Full-Screen TUI Rules, Contract §Global UX Rules]
- [x] CHK030 Are token redaction requirements scoped clearly enough to cover application-generated diagnostics, crash artifacts, and dependency-produced traces without over-claiming what can be controlled? [Ambiguity, Spec §SEC-002, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [x] CHK031 Are assumptions about `/api/v1` availability, anonymous auth support, and one-page activity probing documented consistently as assumptions, dependencies, or compatibility gates? [Consistency, Spec §INT-001, Spec §Assumptions, Contract §Compatibility Rules]
- [x] CHK032 Is explicit development mode defined tightly enough that reviewers can tell what evidence distinguishes intentional HTTP allowance from accidental insecure configuration? [Clarity, Spec §FR-003, Spec §SEC-005, Spec §Assumptions]
- [x] CHK033 Are OS-specific permission and config-directory assumptions documented clearly enough to avoid conflicting interpretations across Linux, macOS, and Windows? [Completeness, Spec §FR-005, Spec §QUAL-001, Plan §Target Platform]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [x] CHK034 Is the boundary between "communication validation", "runtime compatibility validation", and future "real sync" behavior explicit enough to prevent later scope creep into this slice? [Clarity, Spec §FR-009, Spec §INT-001, Plan §Slice Evolution Rules]
- [x] CHK035 Are deferred behaviors listed in the contract mirrored clearly enough in the spec so reviewers do not need the contract to understand what success does not imply? [Gap, Spec §FR-013, Spec §FR-014, Contract §Explicitly Deferred Behavior]
- [x] CHK036 Does the spec define whether user-facing failure categories must be coarse-grained or distinguish token rejection, transport failure, and contract incompatibility separately? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-012, Contract §Validation Result Screen, Contract §Failure Handling Rules]
